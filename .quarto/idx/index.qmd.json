According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/child-mortality) (WHO), an estimated 5,4 million children under the age of five died in 2019, with the overwhelming of these fatalities happening in low-income nations. Many of these fatalities are preventable with access to basic healthcare and nutrition, making this a devastating and unacceptable reality.\n\nMalnutrition is one of the leading causes of infant mortality in low-income nations. WHO estimates that malnutrition causes to around 45 percent of mortality among children under the age of five. This is often the consequence of poverty, lack of access to nourishing food, and inadequate sanitation and hygiene standards. In addition, many children in low-income countries lack access to basic healthcare, such as immunizations and treatment for common childhood diseases like pneumonia and diarrhea.\n\nLack of access to maternal healthcare is a key factor to child mortality in low-income nations, particularly among children under the age of five. Numerous women in these nations lack access to prenatal care, and many give birth at home without the support of skilled medical personnel. This may result in difficulties during delivery that are deadly for both mother and child.\n\nIn addition to malnutrition and lack of access to maternal healthcare, infectious illnesses such as malaria, measles, and HIV/AIDS are also primary causes of death among children under the age of 5. Because these reasons are often intertwined and may intensify one another, it is essential that attempts to address them be coordinated and holistic.\n\nThe [Global Burden of Disease](http://www.healthdata.org/gbd.) (GBD) database, which is managed by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, is a significant resource for comprehending the effect of mortality among children under the age of five in low-income nations. The GBD database contains information on the causes of death in various nations, as well as the risk factors and treatments linked with these fatalities. This information may be used to guide the formulation of policies and programs, as well as to track progress over time.\n\nThe aim of this research is to track global trends in infant and child mortality, with a focus on Bolivia. Furthermore, we look for correlations between child mortality, income level, and the accessibility of high-quality medical care. Our presentation will conclude with an outline of the leading causes of infant mortality and forecasts for this metric.\n\n# Methods\n\n## Database\n\nBecause it gathers so much data from so many nations over such a long time span, the [GBD](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019) database is one of our primary resources.\n\n## Studied variables\n\nIn order to meet our objectives, the following variables were compiled:\n\n-   **Under-5 mortality**, as expressed by probability of death\n-   **Location**, 204 countries and territories and selected subnational locations\n-   **Year**, time period of estimate.\n-   **Cause of death**, disease responsible for death.\n-   **Socio-Demographic Index (SDI)**, is a comprehensive index of developmental status that has a robust relationship to health outcomes. It is calculated as the geometric mean of the indices from zero to one for the total fertility rate among those under the age of twenty-five, the average level of education among those aged fifteen and above, and the lag distributed income per capita. A composite SDI of 0 would indicate the least developed area in terms of health, while an SDI of 1 would indicate the most developed area.\n-   **Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index**, Using the arithmetic mean of scaled mortality-to-incidence ratios and risk-standardized death rates for 32 causes of death that should not occur in the context of timely and good health care\n-   **World Bank country classifications** by income level [2019](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/new-world-bank-country-classifications-income-level-2022-2023)\n\n## Data analysis\n\nThe data were examined for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test; since they did not present a normal distribution, a non-parametric approach was chosen.\n\nFor descriptive statistics, the median and interquartile range will be reported. Data were compared between more than two unpaired groups by performing the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test. The degree of linear relationship between two variables will be assessed by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. The results were considered significant at p \\< 0.05. The machine-learning algorithm [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) will be used to forecast the evolution of infant mortality in the future. Statistical analysis was performed using R software version 4.2.2 (R Development Core Team, 2022).\n\n# Results and discussion\n\n## Mortality in children under 5 years\n\nMortality in children under 5 years of age has decreased considerably in recent decades. However, in some parts of the world, this indicator remains unacceptably high, as shown in @fig-map below.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-map\n#| fig-cap: \"Interactive Map of child mortality in 2019\"\n#| echo: false\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\nunder_5_mortality$location_name <- as.factor(under_5_mortality$location_name)\nunder_5_mortality$age_group_name <- as.factor(under_5_mortality$age_group_name)\nunder_5_mortality$measure_name <- as.factor(under_5_mortality$measure_name)\nunder_5_mortality$sex_name <- as.factor(under_5_mortality$sex_name)\n\nunder_5_mortality %>% \n  filter(year_id == 2019 & sex_name == \"both\") %>%\n  filter(location_name != \"Global\") %>%\n  mutate(location_name_new = fct_recode(location_name, \"Bolivia\" = \"Bolivia (Plurinational State of)\",\n                                        \"Iran\" = \"Iran (Islamic Republic of)\",\n                                        \"Venezuela\" = \"Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)\",\n                                        \"Vietnam\" = \"Viet Nam\",\n                                        \"United States\" = \"United States of America\",\n                                        \"Russia\" = \"Russian Federation\",\n                                        \"Korea\" = \"Republic of Korea\",\n                                        \"Dem.

One of these trends is the decrease in child mortality rates.\n\nAccording to the GBD data and the WHO, Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest under-five mortality rate in the world. One of the leading causes of child mortality in Africa is infectious diseases, such as malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea, and HIV/AIDS. These diseases are often preventable and treatable with appropriate healthcare interventions and access to essential medicines. However, many African countries struggle with limited healthcare infrastructure and resources, leading to inadequate healthcare access and delivery for children. We can now appreciate the strong relationship between infant mortality and access to health care and the country's income level.\n\nChild mortality in Bolivia was quite high in the past, but it has decreased significantly in recent years and is currently lower than the global rate but still above the regional average, as shown in @fig-evolution.\n\nOne of the main drivers of the decline in child mortality in in Bolivia, and Latin America in general, has been the expansion of healthcare coverage and services. This has led to increased access to essential health services such as prenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and vaccination programs, which have helped to reduce the incidence of preventable diseases in children. However, Bolivia still has a long way to go.\n\n![Evolution of under-5 children probability of death, 1950 to 2019](images/evolution.jpg){#fig-evolution}\n\n## The influence of socioeconomic status and access to health care on child mortality\n\nChild mortality is highly related to nation-level development (as assessed by SDI) and access to quality health care (as evaluated by HAQ). In @fig-sdi and @fig-haq were we computed a Spearman's correlation coefficient to assess the linear relationship between HAQ and SDI, and child mortality. There was a negative correlation between the two variables.\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n![Probability of death vs Socio-Demographic Index](images/death%20vs%20sdi_1.jpg){#fig-sdi}\n\n![Probability of death vs Healthcare Access and Quality Index](images/death%20vs%20haq_1.jpg){#fig-haq}\n:::\n\nBolivia is considered a lower middle-income country.The Kurskal-Wallis rank sum test revealed that there was a statistically significant difference in child mortality between all groups, as shown in @fig-anova and @tbl-wilcox. Lower middle-income countries tend to have higher mortality than upper middle-income countries and high-income countries. We can also observe that the higher the country's income, the lower the child mortality rate.\n\n![Probability of death according World bank classification](images/death%20by%20income.jpg){#fig-anova}\n\n|                     | High Income | Upper Middle Income | Lower Middle Income |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Upper Middle Income | \\<0.0001    | \\-                  | \\-                  |\n| Lower Middle Income | \\<0.0001    | \\<0.0001            | \\-                  |\n| Lower Income        | \\<0.0001    | \\<0.0001            | \\<0.0001            |\n\n: Pairwise comparisons using Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction {#tbl-wilcox}\n\nThese findings are consistent with the current literature. Research has consistently shown that children from low-income families are at a higher risk of mortality compared to those from higher-income families. Poverty and lack of resources can limit access to healthcare, nutrition, and education, all of which are essential for the healthy development of children. Children from low-income families are more likely to experience malnutrition, infections, and other health problems that increase their risk of morbidity and mortality.\n\nAccess to healthcare is another important factor that influences child mortality rates. Children who have access to healthcare services such as vaccinations, preventive care, and treatment for illnesses are more likely to survive and thrive. In contrast, children who lack access to healthcare services are at risk of developing severe illnesses that can lead to long-term health problems or even death. Limited access to healthcare services is often a result of poverty, geographic location, or social and cultural barriers that prevent families from seeking care.\n\nEfforts to reduce child mortality rates require a comprehensive approach that addresses both the social determinants of health, such as poverty and inequality, and the availability and accessibility of healthcare services. Improving access to healthcare services for all children, regardless of their socioeconomic status or geographic location, is essential to reducing child mortality rates. Additionally, addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality, such as lack of education, job opportunities, and social protection, can help to improve the overall health and wellbeing of children and families.\n\n## Causes of death\n\nCurrently, the majority of deaths in children under 5 years of age are due to congenital anomalies, as shown in @fig-causes. This was not always the case; as shown in @fig-gganim and @fig-inter, historically, the main cause was pneumonia and respiratory tract infections.\n\n![Causes of death in under-5 children, 2019](images/cause%20of%20death.jpg){#fig-causes}\n\n![Causes of death in Bolivia, 1990 to 2019](images/gganim.gif){#fig-gganim}\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-inter\n#| fig-cap: \"Interactive plot, causes of death in Bolivia, 1990 to 2019 \"\n#| echo: false\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\n\n#data cleaning\n\ncauses_of_death_in_children_bolivia <- causes_of_death_in_children %>%\n  filter(Code == \"BOL\") %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = Malaria:Syphilis,\n    names_to = \"cause\",\n    values_to = \"number_of_deaths\"\n  )\n\ncauses_of_death_in_children_bolivia$cause <- as.factor(causes_of_death_in_children_bolivia$cause)\n\ncauses_of_death_in_children_bolivia$cause <- reorder(causes_of_death_in_children_bolivia$cause, causes_of_death_in_children_bolivia$number_of_deaths)\n\ncauses_of_death_in_children_bolivia %>%\n  dplyr::rename(Disease = cause,\n                Number_of_Deaths = number_of_deaths) %>%\n  group_by(Disease) %>%\n  e_chart(x = Year) %>%\n  e_line(Number_of_Deaths, Disease) %>%\n  #e_add_unnested(Disease) %>%\n  e_axis_labels(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Number of Deaths\"\n  ) %>% \n  e_x_axis(Year) %>%\n  e_legend(type = \"scroll\",\n           selected = list(\n             \"Lower respiratory infections\" = TRUE,\n             \"Congenital birth defects\" = TRUE,\n             \"Diarrheal diseases\" = TRUE,\n             \"Malaria\" = FALSE,\n             \"Measles\" = FALSE,\n             \"Syphilis\" = FALSE,\n             \"Neoplasms\" = FALSE,\n             \"HIV/AIDS\" = FALSE,\n             \"Meningitis\" = FALSE,\n             \"Drowning\" = FALSE,\n             \"Tuberculosis\" = FALSE,\n             \"Whooping cough\" = FALSE,\n             \"Other neonatal disorders\" = FALSE\n           )\n           #orient = \"vertical\"\n           ) %>%\n  e_tooltip(formatter = htmlwidgets::JS(\"\n      function(params){\n        return('<strong>' + params.name + \n        '</strong><br />Year: ' + params.value[0] + \n        '<br />Deaths: ' + params.value[1]\n        )\n      }\n    \")\n  ) %>%\n  e_datazoom(toolbox = FALSE) %>%\n  e_theme(\"essos\")\n```\n\n@fig-inter also shows an enthusiastic development: the decreasing incidence of pediatric pneumonia. In Bolivia, like in other low-income economies, pneumonia was a major cause of death of children under the age of five. However, the frequency of pediatric pneumonia has reduced in recent years owing to increasing availability to immunizations like the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and better diagnosis and treatment.\n\nHowever, while deaths due to pneumonia and diarrhea have declined significantly, the same cannot be said for congenital abnormalities, which continue to account for a significant proportion of child deaths. Congenital abnormalities are a diverse group of disorders that arise during fetal development and can result in physical or mental disability, or even death. In many cases, these abnormalities are genetic and cannot be prevented, but in other cases, they may be related to environmental factors such as maternal exposure to toxins or infections during pregnancy.\n\nDespite advances in medical technology and prenatal care, the incidence of congenital abnormalities has remained relatively stable over the past few decades, and they continue to account for a significant proportion of child deaths worldwide (WHO, 2021). This is partly due to the complexity of these conditions, which can make diagnosis and treatment challenging, and also because many countries lack the resources and infrastructure needed to provide adequate care for affected children.\n\n## Forecasting the Future of Child Mortality\n\nMortality is expected to continue to decline in the future as shown in the @fig-forcast below.\n\nIf current trends continue, we will see a further reduction in infant mortality over the next few years. The advent of new technologies and the advancement of medicine could lead to a reduction in infant deaths due to causes of infant mortality that we cannot control today, such as congenital anomalies.\n\n![Forecast of probability of death until 2030](images/Prediction.jpg){#fig-forcast}\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, infant mortality is a substantial public health problem, especially in low-income nations. The leading causes of these fatalities include malnutrition, lack of access to mother and child healthcare, neonatal causes, and infectious illnesses. The GBD database is a significant resource for understanding the effects of this problem and may be used to guide the creation of policies and programs. It is crucial that all countries collaborate to solve this problem, with a particular emphasis on providing access to basic healthcare, nutrition, and maternity care.\n\n# References\n\n1.
